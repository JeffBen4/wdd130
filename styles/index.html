            <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Hello, my name is Jeffrey Coila." width="200">
            <p>Hello. My name is Jeffrey. I am 21 years old and currently living in the beautiful city of Arequipa, Peru, although I was born in Puno, a place known for its rich culture and the breathtaking Lake Titicaca.

                I have a deep passion for horror video games, with "Resident Evil" being one of my all-time favorites. I enjoy the thrill and excitement that these games bring, as well as the immersive stories they tell.
                
                In addition to gaming, I also love playing the piano. Music has always been a way for me to relax and express myself creatively. Whether it's classical melodies or modern pieces, the piano allows me to connect with my emotions and share them with others.
                
                Both gaming and music are an important part of who I am, and they inspire me to keep learning and exploring new things every day.</p>
